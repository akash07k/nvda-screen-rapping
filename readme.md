This add-on brings the screen rapping feature to nvda.  
Screen rapping is a jaws feature in witch the screen reader goes automaticly to the top of the page  
and vice versa when no more quick navigation items are available in the direction you are going in while using   the single letter navigation keys.

## usage

The use of this add-on is simple, all you have to do is follow the steps below:  

 1. Install the add-on
 2. Go and try to navigate the web using the single letter navigation keys
 3. You can toggle screen rapping on or off using **nvda+h.**  
  Note: you can change the gesture used here from the NVDAInputGestures manager, you will find it under the browse mode category.
